After you download it, double click the executable file.

There'll be a UI telling you to exclude some patches you don't want. You can exclude some of them or not!

If you excluded the microg-support patch, it'll download a compatible YouTube version, patch it and replace your actual YouTube app (you'll need root for this).

If you never used the tool, it should start downloading the YT apk! If you did, it'll prompt you to use the old APK or not. If you say no, it'll download a new APK.

After this, it should start building! This might take shorter or longer, depending on your PC.

After it successfully builds, if you have ADB, it should automatically install ReVanced (and MicroG if you don't have root).

And thats it! You have successfully installed ReVanced! If you encounter any errors, please create an [issue](https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder/issues).
